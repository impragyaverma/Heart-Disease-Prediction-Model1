# Heart-Disease-Prodiction-Model
Age: Age of the patient.
Sex: Gender of the patient (0 = female, 1 = male).
Chest Pain Type (cp): Type of chest pain (0 = typical angina, 1 = atypical angina, 2 = non-anginal pain, 3 = asymptomatic).
Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps): Resting blood pressure in mm Hg.
Cholesterol Level (chol): Serum cholesterol in mg/dl.
Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs): Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true, 0 = false).
Resting Electrocardiographic Results (restecg): Resting electrocardiographic results (0 = normal, 1 = ST-T wave abnormality, 2 = probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach): Maximum heart rate achieved.
Exercise Induced Angina (exang): Exercise induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
ST Depression induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak): ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope): Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0 = downsloping, 1 = flat, 2 = upsloping).
Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy (ca): Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3).
Thalassemia (thal): Thalassemia (0 = normal, 1 = fixed defect, 2 = reversible defect).
These features are used to train the machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in an individual.
